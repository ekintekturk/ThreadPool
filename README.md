Thread Pool Supported Shell – C / C# (Operating Systems Course Project)
Piri Reis University – Management Information Systems
Description:
As part of the Operating Systems course, we developed a custom shell application using a thread pool architecture. Unlike traditional sequential shells, this system processes user commands concurrently by dispatching them to available worker threads. This approach improves system responsiveness and efficiency.
My Role: Authored the methodology section, detailing the technical development process and architecture.
